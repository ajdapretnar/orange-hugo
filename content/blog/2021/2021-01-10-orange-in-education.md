# Orange in Education: Survey Results

We've recently launched a survey on the use of Orange in higher education. We got 417 responses from students, teaching assistants, and professor on how and where they use Orange. The results are quite surprising.

169 respondents were professors, 161 of which we were able to relate to the university. Out of those, 16 are from the USA, 15 from Brazil, 11 from India, 11 from Mexico, and 10 from Turkey. Most of them seem to use Orange outside of classroom (27%), while the most popular subject to use Orange in is computer science (20.5%), followed by text mining (10%).

Most professor use Orange for the analysis of tabular data (19%). The main reason to use Orange is its ease of use.
