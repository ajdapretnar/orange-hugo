Orange is the result of a community effort. Most of its developers are university professors, assistants, and students, who work on Orange in their free time (actually, on Fridays when we hold dedicated development sprints). We always aim to keep our content free, from widgets to textbooks for teachers. We spend time producing YouTube tutorials so that everyone can start using Orange, we try to keep the blog active with new examples and use cases, and we answer your questions on our Discord channel. All of this is voluntary - we are doing this, because we love Orange and we believe it can help us teach data science to anyone!

Since providing the options to donate on our website, we had some generous sponsors during the years. Thank you to each and everyone who thought our work deserves to be rewarded. Now, we decided to take yet another approach to growing Orange. We have recently launched the option to sponsor Orange on our Github page. Github provides the option to sponsor open source software with monthly donations. We designed several tiers, to give everyone a chance to contribute as much as they feel comfortable to.

But as giving deserves receiving, we are launching dedicated sponsor content! Every sponsor opting for tiers 14$ and over gets an exclusive access to the pandas add-on. The add-on packs pandas functions into separate widgets which can be chained just like commands in pandas. In essence, the widgets give a graphical user interface to pandas' functions.

Here's an example.
